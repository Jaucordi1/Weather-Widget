# Weather-Widget

- Developed in `TypeScript`
- Using my [Geolocation-Storage](https://github.com/Jaucordi1/Geolocation-Storage) repo
- Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Designed for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

It works like this
1. Ask the user to allow location access
2. Fetch the weather and save it in local storage
3. Display a responsive widget that shows the current (or last fetched) weather

The widget loads in DOM Element with `id="weather-widget"` attribute.

It is designed to display itself as a Bootstrap Card, like this :
```html
<div class="card my-3" id="weather-widget"></div>
```
