# Weather-Widget

- Developed in `TypeScript`
- Using my [Geolocation-Storage](https://github.com/Jaucordi1/Geolocation-Storage) repo
- Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Designed for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

It works like this
1. Ask the user to allow location access
2. Fetch the weather and save it in local storage
3. Display a responsive widget that shows the current (or last fetched) weather
